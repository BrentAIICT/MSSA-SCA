# AD User Recovery Project
## Recover deleted user from Domain controller Recycle-Bin

- Write a function that does the following
  - Lists all deleted object using the Out-Gridview
  - Allows someone to choose which user to restore
  - Restore the chosen user
  - (Optionally) Show the restored AD object on screen to prove restoration was successful 

## HINTS
```
# This command finds deleted objects
Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter:"(msDS-LastKnownRDN=*)" -IncludeDeletedObjects | Where-Object {$_.Deleted -eq $true}

# This command restores a deleted object 
Restore-ADObject 
```

function Restore-DeletedADObject {
  # Find all of the deleted objects in AD  
  $DeletedObjects = Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter:"(msDS-LastKnownRDN=*)" -IncludeDeletedObjects | Where-Object {$_.Deleted -eq $true}
  $ADObjectsChosen = $DeletedObjects | Out-GridView -OutputMode Multiple  # Choose which objects to restore
  $ADObjectsChosen | Restore-ADObject -confirm:$false # This restores the chosen object
  # this finds the restored objects in AD  
  $RestoredObjects = Get-ADObject -Filter * | Where-Object {$_.ObjectGuid -in $ADObjectsChosen.ObjectGuid}  
  return $RestoredObjects   # Show the restored objects on the screen (this is the optional requirement)
}

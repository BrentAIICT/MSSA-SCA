    #    Accept pipeline input?       True (ByPropertyName)
    #    Accept wildcard characters?  false    
    #
    # This is one of the parameters that can "Accept pipeline input"
    # and it can do so "ByPropertyName"

        Get-Process [-ComputerName <System.String[]>] [-FileVersionInfo ] -Id <System.Int32[]> [-Module ] [<CommonParameters>]
        Get-Process [-ComputerName <System.String[]>] [-FileVersionInfo ] -InputObject <System.Diagnostics.Process[]> [-Module ] [<CommonParameters>]
        Get-Process -Id <System.Int32[]> -IncludeUserName  [<CommonParameters>]
        Get-Process [[-Name] <System.String[]>] -IncludeUserName  [<CommonParameters>] 
        Get-Process -IncludeUserName  -InputObject <System.Diagnostics.Process[]> [<CommonParameters>]

# Lab: Performing remote administration with PowerShell

## Scenario

You're an administrator for Adatum Corporation and must perform maintenance tasks on a server running Windows Server 2019. You don't have physical access to the server, and instead plan to perform the tasks using Windows PowerShell remoting. You also have some tasks to perform on both a server and another client computer that runs Windows 10. In your environment, communication protocols such as remote procedure call (RPC) are blocked between your local computer and the servers. You plan to use Windows PowerShell remoting, and want to use sessions to provide persistence and reduce the setup and cleanup overhead that improvised remoting connections will impose.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

- Enable remoting on a client computer.
- Run a task on a remote computer by using one-to-one remoting.
- Run a task on two computers by using one-to-many remoting.
- Create and manage PSSessions.
- Send commands to multiple computers in parallel.

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Lab Setup

Virtual machines:

- **LON-DC1**
- **LON-CL1**

Username: **Adatum\\Administrator**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

For this lab, you'll use the available virtual machine environment. Before you begin the lab, complete the following steps:

1. Open **LON-DC1**, and then sign in as **Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
1. Repeat step 1 for **LON-CL1**.

## Exercise 1: Enabling remoting on the local computer

### Scenario 1

In this exercise, you'll enable remoting on the client computer.

The main task for this exercise is:

- Enable remoting for incoming connections.

### Task 1: Enable remoting for incoming connections

1. Ensure that you're signed in to **LON-CL1** as **Adatum\\Administrator**.
1. Enable remoting for incoming connections on the **LON-CL1** client computer.

## Exercise 2: Performing one-to-one remoting

### Scenario 2

In this exercise, you'll connect to a remote computer and perform maintenance tasks.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Connect to the remote computer and install an operating system feature on it.
1. Test multi-hop remoting.
1. Observe remoting limitations.


### Task 1: Connect to the remote computer and install an operating system feature on it

1. Ensure that you're still signed in to **LON-CL1**.
1. On **LON-CL1**, in the Windows PowerShell console, use remoting to establish a one-to-one connection to **LON-DC1**.

## Exercise 3: Performing one-to-many remoting

In this exercise, you'll run commands against multiple computers. One of those will be the client computer, although you'll be establishing a second sign-in to it for the duration of each command.

The main tasks for this exercise are:

1. Retrieve a list of physical network adapters from two computers.
1. Compare the output of a local command to that of a remote command.

### Task 1: Retrieve a list of physical network adapters from two computers

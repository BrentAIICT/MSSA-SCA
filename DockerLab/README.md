## Download and install the base image

```
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis
```
> This will probably take 10 minutes to finish

## Querying your local docker image repository

```
docker images
```

## Run the windows container

```
docker run -dit -p 80:80 mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore/iis
```

> *Record the first six characters of the running container, called the container ID*

## Check the container is running

```
docker ps
```

## Find the IP to access the container

> when typing this next command remember to replace ContinerID with the 6 characters recorded earlier
```
docker inspect -f "{{ .NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress }}" ContainerID
```

>*Take note of the IP Address of the container*

## Access the IIS web site on the container

> Open a web browser and type the ipaddress of the container into the address bar <br>
> The default IIS web site should appear

## Stop the container and try accessing the web site again

> when typing this next command remember to replace ContinerID with the 6 characters recorded earlier
```
Docker stop ContainerID
```

> Open a web browser and type the ipaddress of the container into the address bar <br>
> The browser will fail to locate the web site now
